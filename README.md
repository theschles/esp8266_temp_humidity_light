# temp_humidity_light_logger
Arduino project to record and upload temperature, humidity, and light data to the cloud

Uses:
* Open your fridge or freezer and temperatures too hot or too cold?  Know when the last time the fridge was opened (by the last time light was detected).  If it's been a while, your fridge or freezer needs repair or replacement.
* Want to know if areas of your property have enough direct sunlight to grow trees, vegetables, fruit, or herbs?  The data will show you if a location is well-suited for the purpose

Planned add-ons / upgrades:
* Weather station
* Moisture sensor (are the plants getting enough?  too much?)
